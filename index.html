          <h1>Hi, I'm Marin!</h1>

        <h3>User-Centered Design</h3>
        <p>My approach to solving user problems is user-centered design. This means that I start by understanding the user's needs and goals. I then use that information to create a design that is both useful and enjoyable to use. I believe that user-centered design is the best way to create products that people love.</p>

        <h3>User Empathy</h3>
        <p>I believe that user empathy is essential for creating successful designs. I also believe that it is important to test designs with users early and often, in order to get feedback and make sure that the design is meeting their needs. When designers are able to understand and empathize with their users, they are able to create designs that are more user-friendly, effective, and enjoyable.</p>

        <h3>Enjoyable Interfaces</h3>
        <p>When it comes to making creating enjoyable interfaces, I take a number of factors into consideration. I consider the colors, fonts, and overall layout of the interface. I also consider the overall look and feel, and make sure that it is visually appealing and engaging.</p>
